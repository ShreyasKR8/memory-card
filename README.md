# Memory Card Game

A memory-based game built with React. The goal of the game is to click on unique cards without clicking on the same card twice. Each card represents an image fetched dynamically from an API.

## Features

- **Dynamic Images**: Images are fetched from an external API (`The Cat API`) and displayed as cards.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the current score and high score.
- **Shuffle Mechanism**: Cards are shuffled after every click.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating a responsive and visually appealing card layout.
- **The Cat API**: For fetching random cat images.
